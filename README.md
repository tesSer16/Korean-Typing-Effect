# Korean-Typing-Effect
This is my blog posting that explains how I designed the algorithms and code -> https://blog.naver.com/jwjung0907/222426116783 (written in Korean)

Let me briefly introduce my work.
This code can disassemble/assemble Korean sentence to vowels and consonants.
To implement typing-effect, it disassembles entire sentence,
then by adding 1 character repeatedly, it assembles them.
Here is an example of how it works:D
